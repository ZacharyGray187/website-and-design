		hello
		</H1>
		<P>
			some of the things that i like to do are long boarding and play video games. I like to long board because it is a fun activity
			and i love the adrenalin rush when i ride down big hill because i don't know what comes next. And i like to play video games
			because it can help me relax after a hard day from work and school and i like to spend time with my friends playing our favorite games.

		i love mint ice cream with hot fudge and marshmellows
